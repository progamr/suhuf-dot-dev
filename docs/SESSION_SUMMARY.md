   - Better error handling and loading states

5. `/src/modules/feed/components/PublicFeed.tsx`
   - Uses useQuery for data fetching
   - Proper caching and error handling

6. `/src/app/articles/[id]/ArticleDetailClient.tsx`
   - Uses useQuery for article and related articles
   - Added authentication state check
