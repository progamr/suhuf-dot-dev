---

---

### 2. Onboarding Page (`/onboarding`)

**File:** `/src/app/onboarding/page.tsx`

- Server component with auth check
- Redirects to login if not authenticated
- Passes userId to client component
- **Status:** ✅ Complete

---

### 3. Onboarding Form Component

### 4. Middleware Protection

**File:** `/src/middleware.ts`

**Logic:**
1. **If user is logged in:**
   - Check `onboarding_completed` cookie
   - If no cookie, fetch preferences from API
   - If preferences incomplete (< 2 sources or < 2 categories):
     - Redirect to `/onboarding` (unless already there)
   - If preferences complete:
     - Set `onboarding_completed` cookie
     - Redirect to `/` if trying to access `/onboarding`

2. **If user is not logged in:**
   - Redirect to `/login` if trying to access `/onboarding`

3. **Cookie Management:**
   - `onboarding_completed` cookie set for 1 year
   - Prevents repeated API checks
   - Cleared when user logs out

**Status:** ✅ Complete

## 🔄 User Flow

### New User Journey:
```
1. User signs up → Email verification
2. User logs in → Middleware checks preferences
3. No preferences found → Redirect to /onboarding
4. User selects 2+ sources → Click "Next"
5. User selects 2+ categories → Click "Next"
6. User optionally selects authors → Click "Complete Setup" or "Skip"
7. Preferences saved → Cookie set → Redirect to /
8. User sees authenticated home page
```

### Returning User Journey:
```
1. User logs in → Middleware checks cookie
2. Cookie exists → Allow access to home
3. User tries to access /onboarding → Redirect to /
```

### User Updates Preferences Later:
```
1. User goes to /settings (future feature)
2. Updates preferences
3. Cookie remains valid
```
